# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Write A Program That Takes two set Objects from the User and performs the following
- Union 
- Intersection
- Difference
- Symmetric Differece 
and displays the result

## EXPECTED OUTPUT:
        Enter The size Of First Set Object: 6
        Enter The size Of Second Set object: 6


        Enter the 1 element for set1: 1
        Enter the 2 element for set1: 4
        Enter the 3 element for set1: 6
        Enter the 4 element for set1: 2
        Enter the 5 element for set1: 7
        Enter the 6 element for set1: 8


        Enter the 1 element for set2: 4
        Enter the 2 element for set2: 1
        Enter the 3 element for set2: 3
        Enter the 4 element for set2: 7
        Enter the 5 element for set2: 2
        Enter the 6 element for set2: 5

        s1 = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
        s2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

        The Union of Two sets are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
        The intersection of two sets are: {1, 2, 4, 7}
        The Difference of two sets are: {8, 6}
        The Symmetric Difference of two sets are: {3, 5, 6, 8}
