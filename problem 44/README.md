## OUTPUT
        Enter the length of the traingle: 12
        Enter the breadth of the traingle: 13

        Area of the traingle is 78.0

        Enter a number: 56

        Adding the number to the result we get 134.0

        Do you want to check more subjects? (y/n): y

        Enter the length of the traingle: 23
        Enter the breadth of the traingle: 24

        Area of the traingle is 276.0

        Enter a number: 6

        Adding the number to the result we get 282.0

        Do you want to check more subjects? (y/n): n
