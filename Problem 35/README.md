# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Write A Python Program To Get A Angle From The User And Find Its Sin And Cos Value In Radian And Then Convert Their Result In Degree Unit.


## OUTPUT
        Enter an angle from keyboard: 23

        SIN() AND COSINE() OF THE ANGLE IN RADIAN
        sin(0.4014257279586958) = 0.39073112848927377
        cos(0.4014257279586958) = 0.9205048534524404

        SIN() AND COSINE() OF THE ANGLE IN RADIAN
        sin(23.0) = -0.8462204041751706
        cos(23.0) = -0.5328330203333975
