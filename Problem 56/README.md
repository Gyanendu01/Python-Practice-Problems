        If you want to convert Bytes to Giga-bytes enter 'BG':
        gjj

        If you want to convert Giga-bytes to bytes enter 'GB'
        If you want to convert Bytes to Giga-bytes enter 'BG':
        ty5

        If you want to convert Giga-bytes to bytes enter 'GB'
        If you want to convert Bytes to Giga-bytes enter 'BG':
        gb

        Enter a value: 3

         3 Giga-bytes converted to bytes: 3000
