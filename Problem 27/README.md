# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write A Python Program To Get A  Number From User And Check if It Is Divisible By 5 And 6


## EXPECTED OUTPUT

### OUTPUT 
        
        Enter a number to check if it is divisible by both 5 AND 6: 65

        65.0 is not divisible by both 5 AND 6

        Do you want to check another number? (y/n): y

        Enter a number to check if it is divisible by both 5 AND 6: 34

        34.0 is not divisible by both 5 AND 6

        Do you want to check another number? (y/n): hh

        Do you want to check another number? (y/n): htyy

        Do you want to check another number? (y/n): y

        Enter a number to check if it is divisible by both 5 AND 6: 30

        30.0 is divisible by both 5 AND 6

        Do you want to check another number? (y/n): n
