# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Write A Program That Performs All Arithmetic Operations On Two Variables.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
 Enter The First Number For Addition: 2
        Enter The Second Number For Addition: 5
        The sum(2.0,5.0) = 7.0

        Enter The First Number For Subtraction: 6
        Enter The Second Number For Subtraction: 2
        The subtraction(6.0,2.0) = 4.0
        Enter The First Number For Division: 5
        Enter The Second Number For Division: 2
        The Division(5.0,2.0) = 2.5

        Enter The First Number For Floor Division: 4
        Enter The Second Number For Floor Division: 2
        The Floor Division(4.0,2.0) = 2.0

        Enter The First Number For Modulo Division: 4
        Enter The Second Number For Modulo Division: 2
        The Modulo Division(4.0,2.0) = 0.0

        Enter The Base Value For Exponentiation: 4
        Enter The Exponent Value For Exponentiation: 2
        The Exponentiation of 4.0 raised to the power 2.0 = 16.0
